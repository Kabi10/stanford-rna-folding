1. Go to [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
2. Click "New Dataset" 
3. Upload `kaggle_dataset_package.zip`
4. Title: "Stanford RNA 3D Folding Dataset"
5. Make it **Private**
6. Publish

### 2. Create Kaggle Notebook (2 minutes)
1. Go to [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
2. Click "New Notebook"
3. Upload `kaggle/stanford_rna_folding_gpu_training.ipynb`
4. **Add your dataset** to the notebook
5. **Enable GPU** (Settings → Accelerator → GPU)

### 3. Run Training (2-4 hours)

## ⚡ Expected Performance

### GPU Configurations (Auto-detected)

| GPU Type | Memory | Batch Size | Expected Speedup | Training Time |
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| **V100** | 32GB   | 48         | 75-125x         | 1-1.5 hours   |
| **P100** | 16GB   | 24         | 40-75x          | 1.5-2.5 hours |
| **T4**   | 16GB   | 16         | 25-50x          | 2-4 hours     |
| **K80**  | 12GB   | 12         | 15-30x          | 3-6 hours     |

### Target Metrics
- **RMSD**: < 5.0 Å (competitive performance)
- **TM-score**: > 0.3 (good structural similarity)
- **Model size**: 3.96M parameters (~16 MB)

## 🎯 Model Features

### Architecture
- **Physics-Enhanced Transformer** with biophysical constraints
- **6 layers, 8 heads**, 256/512 embedding/hidden dimensions
- **Single-atom prediction**: x_1, y_1, z_1 coordinates
- **Mixed precision training** for GPU efficiency

### Physics Constraints
- **Bond length constraints**: Realistic C-C, C-N, C-O distances
- **Bond angle constraints**: Proper molecular geometry
- **Steric clash avoidance**: Prevent atom overlap
- **Watson-Crick pairing**: RNA base pair constraints

### Optimization
- **Adam optimizer** with learning rate scheduling
- **Gradient accumulation** for effective large batch sizes
- **Early stopping** with patience-based monitoring
- **Automatic GPU memory management**

---

## 📊 Resource Management

### Kaggle Quota Usage
- **GPU Quota**: 30 hours available
- **Expected usage**: 2-6 hours for full training
- **Remaining quota**: 24-28 hours for experiments

### Recommended Strategy
1. **First run**: Standard config (2-4 hours)
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: 2-3 additional experiments
3. **Final model**: Best configuration with extended training

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Out of Memory (OOM)
```yaml
# Reduce batch size in config
batch_size: 12  # Instead of 24
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4  # Maintain effective batch size
```

#### Slow Training
```python
# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi  # Should show >90% GPU usage
```

#### NaN Loss
```yaml
# Lower learning rate
learning_rate: 2e-4  # Instead of 5e-4
gradient_clip_val: 0.5  # Stronger clipping
```

#### Import Errors
```python
# Ensure dataset is properly attached
sys.path.insert(0, '/kaggle/input/stanford-rna-3d-folding')
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analysis

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **GPU utilization**: Target >90%
- **Memory usage**: Target 80-90% of available
- **Training loss**: Should decrease steadily
- **Validation RMSD**: Target <5.0 Å
- **Batch processing time**: Monitor for bottlenecks

### Available Analysis Tools
```python
# Load additional analysis functions
exec(open('/kaggle/input/stanford-rna-3d-folding/scripts/notebook_additional_cells.py').read())

# Use analysis functions
analyze_training_results()
create_performance_summary()
export_trained_model()
calculate_resource_usage()
```
