#### PowerShell Helper Scripts (Recommended Workflow)

To streamline interaction with Kaggle, use these PowerShell scripts:

1.  **Push and Run on Kaggle GPU:**
```powershell
./run_on_kaggle.ps1 
```
    *   Activates the environment.
    *   Pushes `rna_folding_kaggle.py` to Kaggle.
    *   Starts a new kernel run with GPU enabled.
    *   Outputs the kernel ID (e.g., `username/stanford-rna-3d-folding-run-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM`).

2.  **Check Status of All Kernels:**
```powershell
./check_kaggle_kernels.ps1
```
    *   Lists your recent kernels and their status.

3.  **Check Status of a Specific Kernel:**
```powershell
./check_kernel_status.ps1 -KernelId "username/kernel-slug" 
```
    *   Checks the status of a specific run.
    *   Provides the direct URL to the kernel on Kaggle.

4.  **Pull Results:**
```powershell
./pull_kaggle_results.ps1 -KernelId "username/kernel-slug"

# Push using our custom script
python scripts\push_to_kaggle.py push rna_folding_kaggle.py --competition stanford-rna-3d-folding --title "Stanford RNA 3D Folding - Initial Setup"
```

#### Pushing Code to Kaggle (Option 2: Direct Kaggle API)

```bash
# Activate the environment first
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell

# Use Kaggle API directly
kaggle kernels push -p . -k stanford-rna-3d-folding/initial-setup
```

**Progress Report:**
I've implemented three specialized attention mechanisms for RNA structure prediction, specifically designed to address the unique challenges in this domain:

1. **Base Pairing-Aware Attention:** This attention mechanism incorporates RNA base-pairing rules (Watson-Crick and wobble pairs) directly into the attention weights, giving higher scores to valid complementary bases.

2. **Hierarchical Attention:** This architecture models RNA at multiple organizational levels - primary sequence, secondary structure, and tertiary structure. Each level has dedicated attention heads that capture different aspects of RNA organization.

3. **Distance-Modulated Attention:** This uses a geometry-aware attention mechanism that scales attention weights based on the estimated physical distances between nucleotides, enabling iterative refinement of the 3D structure prediction.

4. **Model Adapter System:** Created a flexible adapter system that allows easy swapping between different attention mechanisms through configuration files, facilitating experimentation.

5. **Memory Optimization:** Implemented gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage during training, allowing for deeper models and longer RNA sequences. Also added mixed precision training and gradient accumulation for further efficiency.

Next steps include training and evaluating these architectures, benchmarking their performance, and identifying any remaining bottlenecks in the training pipeline.
