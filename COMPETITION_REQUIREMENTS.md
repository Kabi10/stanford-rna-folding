# Stanford RNA 3D Folding Competition Requirements

## Competition Overview

**Competition Name:** Stanford RNA 3D Folding  
**Platform:** Kaggle  
**Type:** Code Competition  
**Status:** Active (as of January 2025)  
**Deadline:** September 24, 2025 (23:59:00 UTC)  
**Prize Pool:** TBD (Check competition page for current details)  

## Problem Statement

The Stanford RNA 3D Folding competition challenges participants to predict the 3D structure of RNA molecules from their sequences. This is a fundamental problem in computational biology with applications in drug discovery, understanding biological processes, and RNA engineering.

### Key Objectives
- Predict 3D atomic coordinates for RNA structures
- Generate multiple diverse structural conformations per RNA sequence
- Achieve high accuracy in structural prediction compared to experimental data

## Dataset Description

### Training Data
- **train_sequences.csv**: 844 RNA sequences with metadata
  - Columns: `ID`, `sequence`
  - Sequence lengths: 3-4,298 nucleotides (average: 162.4)
  - GC content: 55.2% ± 12.5%

- **train_labels.csv**: 137,095 3D coordinate points
  - Columns: `ID`, `resname`, `resid`, `x_1`, `y_1`, `z_1`
  - Represents atomic coordinates for 735 unique RNA structures
  - Average atoms per structure: 186.5

### Validation Data
- **validation_sequences.csv**: 12 RNA sequences
- **validation_labels.csv**: 2,515 coordinate points

### Test Data
- **test_sequences.csv**: 12 RNA sequences (targets for prediction)
- **sample_submission.csv**: 2,515 entries (submission format template)

## Submission Requirements

### Format
Submissions must follow the exact format specified in `sample_submission.csv`:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each atom position (format: `{sequence_id}_{atom_index}`)
- **x_1, y_1, z_1**: Predicted 3D coordinates for each atom

### Multiple Structures
The competition requires generating **5 diverse structural conformations** for each RNA sequence:
- Each structure should represent a plausible 3D conformation
- Diversity between structures is encouraged
- All 5 structures contribute to the final evaluation

### File Requirements
- CSV format with exact column names matching sample submission
- All coordinate values must be numeric (float)
- No missing values allowed
- File size limits apply (check competition rules)

## Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metric: Global Distance Test (GDT)
The competition uses GDT-based scoring to evaluate structural accuracy:
- Measures fraction of atoms within distance thresholds of true structure
- Multiple distance cutoffs (typically 1Å, 2Å, 4Å, 8Å)
- Higher scores indicate better structural accuracy

### Secondary Considerations
- **Diversity Bonus**: Rewards for generating diverse conformations
- **Physics Constraints**: Structures should satisfy basic molecular geometry
- **Ensemble Scoring**: All 5 structures contribute to final score

## Technical Constraints

### Computational Resources
- **Memory**: Models must fit within Kaggle's memory limits
- **Runtime**: Inference time limits apply for final submissions
- **GPU**: CUDA-enabled GPUs available in Kaggle environment

### Code Requirements
- Python-based solutions preferred
- Must run in Kaggle's containerized environment
- All dependencies must be installable via pip/conda
- Code must be reproducible with fixed random seeds

## Key Challenges

### Scientific Challenges
1. **RNA Flexibility**: RNA molecules are highly flexible with multiple stable conformations
2. **Long-Range Interactions**: Base pairing and tertiary structure interactions
3. **Sequence-Structure Relationship**: Complex mapping from sequence to 3D structure
4. **Data Scarcity**: Limited experimental 3D RNA structures available

### Technical Challenges
1. **Scale**: Sequences up to 4,298 nucleotides require efficient algorithms
2. **Diversity**: Generating multiple distinct conformations per sequence
3. **Accuracy**: Achieving atomic-level precision in coordinate prediction
4. **Speed**: Fast inference for real-time applications
